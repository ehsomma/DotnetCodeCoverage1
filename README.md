This project shows how to use code coverage in dotnet and how you can publish the results in the repo readme with badges. 

It uses code coverage (in "covertura" format) with Github Actions and Coveralls. [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) will read the covertura.xml and will generate the coverage result badge and a beautiful and detailed report of the coverage.
